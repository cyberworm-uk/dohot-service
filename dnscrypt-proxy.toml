# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# dohot notes:

# 1/ this configuration expects dnscrypt-proxy version 2.0.44 or
# higher; if you are locked into using a lower version than that,
# it MUST be at/above version 2.0.39, and you will need to amend
# the URLs in the "[sources]" section to use the "/v2/" PATHNAMES
# file format, as annotated in that section.

# 2/ gradually this configuration is being pared-down to only set
# values which are relevant and are necessary for clarity, or for
# dohot to work efficiently; all the rest are inherited defaults

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# listen on port 53, all interfaces

# see the URL below for details, add the names here...

# 3/ https://download.dnscrypt.info/resolvers-list/v3/onion-services.md

# UPDATE 2021-02: if you comment-out "server_names" (recommended)
# then you will greatly increase the size of your load-balancing DoH
# pool; however doing so MAY restrict access to `onion-cloudflare`
# because of source ordering issues. I'm looking to fix this somehow.
